## Chat App 

### About the App
This is a basic chat application that uses a REST API for CRUD operations. This app also uses AJAX to implement polling for the messages.
The application allows users to create a profile. Once registered, a user may write messages and post to the app. Any user registered will be able to view messages sent by others also registered.
